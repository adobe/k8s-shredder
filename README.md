A common issue that kubernetes operators run into is how to balance the requirements of long-running workloads with the need to periodically cycle through worker nodes (e.g. for a kubernetes upgrade or configuration change).  Stateful set workloads (kafka, zookeeper, 
rabbitmq, redis, etc) may be sensitive to rescheduling, or application developers may simply deploy applications with pod disruption budgets that do not allow pod eviction at all.  k8s-shredder is a tool that allows the operator to automatically try to soft-evict and reschedule workloads on "parked nodes" over a set period of time before hard-deleting pods.  It does so while exposing metrics that application stewards can monitor and take action, allowing them to take whatever action is needed to reschedule their application off the node slated for replacement.

## What are "parked nodes"?

You can find more about node parking [here](docs/node-parking.md).

## Advantages of parking nodes and shredding pods

- allow teams running stateful apps to move their workloads off of parked nodes at their will, independent of node lifecycle
- optimizes cloud costs by dynamically purging unschedulable workers nodes (parked nodes).
- notifies (via metrics) clients that they are running workloads on parked nodes so that they can take proper actions.

## Getting started

You can deploy k8s-shredder in your cluster by using the [helm chart](charts/k8s-shredder).

Then, during a cluster upgrade, while rotating the worker nodes, you will need to label the nodes and the non-daemonset pods it contains with labels similar to this:

```bash
shredder.ethos.adobe.net/parked-by=k8s-shredder
shredder.ethos.adobe.net/parked-node-expires-on=1750164865.36373
shredder.ethos.adobe.net/upgrade-status=parked
```

You can either park (e.g. label the nodes and pods) with your own cluster management tooling, or you can configure k8s-shredder to park nodes for you based on [karpenter node claim status](#karpenter-integration) or the presence of a [specific label on the node](#labeled-node-detection).

The following options can be used to customize the k8s-shredder controller:

### How it works

k8s-shredder will periodically run eviction loops, based on configured `EvictionLoopInterval`, trying to clean up all the pods from the parked nodes. Once all the pods are cleaned up, [cluster-autoscaler](

https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) or [karpenter](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter) should chime in and recycle the parked node.

The diagram below describes a simple flow about how k8s-shredder handles stateful set applications:

<img src="docs/k8s-shredder.gif" alt="K8s-Shredder project"/>

#### Karpenter Integration

k8s-shredder includes an optional feature for automatic detection of drifted Karpenter NodeClaims. This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `EnableKarpenterDriftDetection` to `true`. When enabled, at the beginning of each eviction loop, the controller will:

1. Scan the Kubernetes cluster for Karpenter NodeClaims that are marked as "Drifted"
2. Identify the nodes associated with these drifted NodeClaims
3. Automatically process these nodes by:

   - **Labeling** nodes and their non-DaemonSet pods with:
       - `UpgradeStatusLabel` (set to "parked") 
       - `ExpiresOnLabel` (set to current time + `ParkedNodeTTL`)
       - `ParkedByLabel` (set to "k8s-shredder")
       - Any labels specified in `ExtraParkingLabels`
   - **Cordoning** the nodes to prevent new pod scheduling
   - **Tainting** the nodes with the configured `ParkedNodeTaint`

This integration allows k8s-shredder to automatically handle node lifecycle management for clusters using Karpenter, ensuring that drifted nodes are properly marked for eviction and eventual replacement.

#### Karpenter Disruption Detection

k8s-shredder includes an optional feature for automatic detection of disrupted Karpenter NodeClaims. This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `EnableKarpenterDisruptionDetection` to `true`. When enabled, at the beginning of each eviction loop, the controller will:

1. Scan the Kubernetes cluster for Karpenter NodeClaims that are marked as disrupted (e.g., "Disrupting", "Terminating", "Empty", "Underutilized")
2. Identify the nodes associated with these disrupted NodeClaims
3. Automatically process these nodes by:

   - **Labeling** nodes and their non-DaemonSet pods with:
       - `UpgradeStatusLabel` (set to "parked") 
       - `ExpiresOnLabel` (set to current time + `ParkedNodeTTL`)
       - `ParkedByLabel` (set to "k8s-shredder")
       - Any labels specified in `ExtraParkingLabels`
   - **Cordoning** the nodes to prevent new pod scheduling
   - **Tainting** the nodes with the configured `ParkedNodeTaint`

This integration ensures that nodes undergoing disruption as part of bin-packing operations have all pods evicted in a reasonable amount of time, preventing them from getting stuck due to blocking Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs). It complements the drift detection feature by handling nodes that are actively being disrupted by Karpenter's consolidation and optimization processes.

#### Labeled Node Detection

k8s-shredder includes optional automatic detection of nodes with specific labels. This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled by setting `EnableNodeLabelDetection` to `true`. When enabled, at the beginning of each eviction loop, the application will:

1. Scan the Kubernetes cluster for nodes that match any of the configured label selectors in `NodeLabelsToDetect`
2. Support both key-only (`"maintenance"`) and key=value (`"upgrade=required"`) label formats
3. Automatically process matching nodes by:

   - **Labeling** nodes and their non-DaemonSet pods with:
       - `UpgradeStatusLabel` (set to "parked") 
       - `ExpiresOnLabel` (set to current time + `ParkedNodeTTL`)
       - `ParkedByLabel` (set to "k8s-shredder")
       - Any labels specified in `ExtraParkingLabels`
   - **Cordoning** the nodes to prevent new pod scheduling
   - **Tainting** the nodes with the configured `ParkedNodeTaint`

This integration allows k8s-shredder to automatically handle node lifecycle management based on custom labeling strategies, enabling teams to mark nodes for parking using their own operational workflows and labels.  For example, this can be used in conjunction with [AKS cluster upgrades](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster#set-new-cordon-behavior).

#### Parking Limits with MaxParkedNodes

k8s-shredder supports limiting the maximum number of nodes that can be parked simultaneously using the `MaxParkedNodes` configuration option. This feature helps prevent overwhelming the cluster with too many parked nodes at once, which could impact application availability.

`MaxParkedNodes` can be specified as either:
- **Integer value** (e.g., `"5"`): Absolute maximum number of nodes that can be parked
- **Percentage value** (e.g., `"20%"`): Maximum percentage of total cluster nodes that can be parked (calculated dynamically each cycle)

When `MaxParkedNodes` is set to a non-zero value:

1. **Parse the limit**: The configuration is parsed to determine the actual limit
   - For percentages: `limit = (percentage / 100) * totalNodes` (rounded down)
   - For integers: `limit = configured value`
2. **Count parked nodes**: k8s-shredder counts the number of currently parked nodes
3. **Calculate available slots**: `availableSlots = limit - currentlyParked`
4. **Sort by age**: Eligible nodes are sorted by creation timestamp (oldest first) to ensure predictable parking order
5. **Limit parking**: If the number of eligible nodes exceeds available slots, only the oldest `availableSlots` nodes are parked
6. **Skip if full**: If no slots are available (currentlyParked >= limit), parking is skipped for that eviction interval

**Examples:**
- `MaxParkedNodes: "0"` (default): No limit, all eligible nodes are parked
- `MaxParkedNodes: "5"`: Maximum 5 nodes can be parked at any time
- `MaxParkedNodes: "20%"`: Maximum 20% of total cluster nodes can be parked (e.g., 2 nodes in a 10-node cluster)
- Invalid values (e.g., `"-1"`, `"invalid"`): Treated as 0 (no limit) with a warning logged

**Percentage Benefits:**
- **Dynamic scaling**: Limit automatically adjusts as cluster size changes
- **Proportional safety**: Maintains a consistent percentage of available capacity regardless of cluster size
- **Auto-scaling friendly**: Works well with cluster auto-scaling by recalculating limits each cycle

**Predictable Parking Order:**
Eligible nodes are **always sorted by creation timestamp (oldest first)**, regardless of whether `MaxParkedNodes` is set. This ensures:
- **Consistent behavior**: The same nodes will be parked first across multiple eviction cycles
- **Fair rotation**: Oldest nodes are prioritized for replacement during rolling upgrades
- **Predictable capacity**: You can anticipate which nodes will be parked next when slots become available
- **Deterministic ordering**: Even when parking all eligible nodes (no limit), they are processed in a predictable order

This sorting behavior applies to both Karpenter drift detection and node label detection features. When multiple nodes are eligible for parking:
- **With no limit** (`MaxParkedNodes: "0"`): All nodes are parked in order from oldest to newest
- **With a limit**: Only the oldest nodes up to the limit are parked; newer nodes wait for the next eviction interval

**Use cases:**
- **Gradual node replacement**: Control the pace of node cycling during cluster upgrades
- **Resource management**: Prevent excessive resource pressure from too many parked nodes
- **Application stability**: Ensure applications have sufficient capacity during node transitions
- **Cost optimization**: Balance between node replacement speed and cluster stability
- **Auto-scaling clusters**: Use percentage-based limits to maintain consistent safety margins as cluster size changes

#### ExtraParkingLabels

The `ExtraParkingLabels` option allows you to specify a map of additional Kubernetes labels that will be applied to all nodes and pods during the parking process. This is useful for custom automation, monitoring, or compliance workflows.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
ExtraParkingLabels:
  example.com/owner: "infrastructure"
  example.com/maintenance: "true"
  example.com/upgrade-batch: "batch-1"
```

**Use cases:**
- **Team ownership**: Mark parked nodes with team ownership labels for accountability
- **Maintenance tracking**: Add labels to track maintenance windows or upgrade batches
- **Compliance**: Apply labels required by compliance or governance policies
- **Monitoring**: Enable custom alerting or monitoring based on parking labels
- **Automation**: Trigger external automation workflows based on parking labels

**Behavior:**
- Labels are applied to both nodes and their non-DaemonSet pods during parking
- Labels are removed during the unparking process (if `EvictionSafetyCheck` triggers unparking)
- If not set or empty, no extra labels are applied
- Labels are applied in addition to the standard parking labels (`UpgradeStatusLabel`, `ExpiresOnLabel`, `ParkedByLabel`)

#### EvictionSafetyCheck

The `EvictionSafetyCheck` feature provides an additional safety mechanism to prevent force eviction of pods that weren't properly prepared for parking. When enabled (default: `true`), k8s-shredder performs a safety check before force evicting pods from expired parked nodes.

**How it works:**

1. **Before force eviction**: When a node's TTL expires and force eviction is about to begin, k8s-shredder checks all non-DaemonSet and non-static pods on the node
2. **Required labels check**: Each pod must have:
   - `UpgradeStatusLabel` set to "parked"
   - `ExpiresOnLabel` present with any value
3. **Safety decision**: 
   - If **all** pods have the required labels → proceed with force eviction
   - If **any** pod is missing required labels → unpark the node instead of force evicting

**Unparking process:**
When safety check fails, k8s-shredder automatically unparks the node by:
- Removing `ExpiresOnLabel` and `ExtraParkingLabels` from nodes and pods
- Removing the `ParkedNodeTaint`
- Uncordoning the node (making it schedulable again)
- Setting `UpgradeStatusLabel` to "unparked" on nodes and pods
- Setting `ParkedByLabel` to the configured `ParkedByValue`

**Use cases:**
- **Safety during manual parking**: If nodes are manually parked but pods weren't properly labeled
- **Partial parking failures**: When parking automation fails to label all pods
- **Emergency recovery**: Provides a safe way to recover from parking mistakes
- **Compliance**: Ensures only properly prepared workloads are force evicted

**Configuration:**
```yaml
EvictionSafetyCheck: true  # Enable safety checks (default)
EvictionSafetyCheck: false # Disable safety checks (force eviction always proceeds)
```

**Logging:**
When safety checks fail, k8s-shredder logs detailed information about which pods are missing required labels, helping operators understand why the node was unparked instead of force evicted.

#### Parking Reason Tracking

k8s-shredder automatically tracks why nodes and pods were parked by applying a configurable parking reason label. This feature helps operators understand the source of parking actions and enables better monitoring and debugging.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
ParkingReasonLabel: "shredder.ethos.adobe.net/parked-reason"  # Default label name
```

**Parking Reason Values:**
- `node-label`: Node was parked due to node label detection
- `karpenter-drifted`: Node was parked due to Karpenter drift detection
- `karpenter-disrupted`: Node was parked due to Karpenter disruption detection

**Behavior:**
- The parking reason label is applied to both nodes and their non-DaemonSet pods during parking
- The label is automatically removed during the unparking process (e.g., when safety checks fail)
- The label value corresponds to the detection method that triggered the parking action
- This label works alongside other parking labels and doesn't interfere with existing functionality

**Use cases:**
- **Monitoring**: Track which detection method is most active in your cluster
- **Debugging**: Understand why specific nodes were parked
- **Automation**: Trigger different workflows based on parking reason
- **Compliance**: Audit parking actions and their sources
